This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).

Its a simple little app that i had to build as part of a tech test a while ago. The goal was not to spend time on CSS and UI but simply build a an app uses the lastFm API. The app had to be able to search for the top artists in a selected country and then display a list of those artists, each with a thumbnail which then linked to another page where you could view the top tracks for those artists.
